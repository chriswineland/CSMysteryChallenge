Hello and Thanks agian for your time!
I have made an app that fetched couchsurfing Tumblr posts and displayes them in a tableview.
once the data has loaded you can tap a cell and cycle through all the images assoceated with a single post
I used the refresh object to alow the user to refetch data (pull down on the table view once already at the top)

--Some cool things in the app--
ImageStore is a cool little cache, it adds a layer of obfiscation to returning imagis. it fakes as if it has the image with the place holder even if it needs to fetch the image. This construct also cuts down on network calls which saves the users battery (Thumbs up)

I created my first NIB! Im sure there is much room for improvement there however it didnt kill me :)

After doing a couple of Unit Tests in XCT I would highly recomend using KIWI, I just scraped the surface with testing in XCT but after reading tutoreals and the apple docs it just does not read out as KIWI does.

I tried to comment a little more then I normaly would but if you have any questions feel free to send me an IM or text, I would be happy to chat about it :)
